Making croissants from scratch is a rewarding but time-intensive process that involves a technique called **lamination**, where layers of dough and butter are folded together to create the signature flakiness. Here’s a basic recipe to guide you through the steps:

### Ingredients:
#### For the Dough (Pâte à Croissant):
- 500g (4 cups) all-purpose flour
- 10g (2 tsp) salt
- 80g (⅓ cup) sugar
- 20g (2 tbsp) fresh yeast or 7g (1 packet) active dry yeast
- 300ml (1 ¼ cups) cold whole milk
- 40g (3 tbsp) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 egg (for egg wash)

#### For the Butter Block:
- 250g (1 cup) unsalted butter, cold and cut into small cubes

### Instructions:

#### **Step 1: Prepare the Dough**
1. **Activate the yeast** (if using dry yeast): In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in a few tablespoons of warm milk (not hot), and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy. If using fresh yeast, crumble it directly into the milk.
   
2. **Mix the dough**: In a large bowl or a stand mixer, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. Add the yeast mixture (or the fresh yeast directly into the dry ingredients) and the remaining cold milk. Mix until a rough dough forms.
   
3. **Knead the dough**: Knead the dough by hand or with a dough hook in the stand mixer for about 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth but still a little sticky. You can add a tiny bit of flour if it’s too wet, but be careful not to add too much.
   
4. **Rest the dough**: Shape the dough into a ball, cover it with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and let it rest in the fridge for at least 1 hour. This helps the dough relax and makes it easier to roll out later.

#### **Step 2: Prepare the Butter Block**
1. **Soften the butter**: Place the cold butter cubes between two pieces of parchment paper or plastic wrap. Using a rolling pin, pound and roll the butter out into a 7-inch (18 cm) square. It should be firm but pliable, not too soft or melted. Chill the butter square in the fridge if needed to maintain its firmness.

#### **Step 3: Laminate the Dough**
1. **Roll out the dough**: After the dough has rested, roll it into a large rectangle (about 16 x 10 inches or 40 x 25 cm).
   
2. **Place the butter block**: Place the chilled butter square in the center of the dough. Fold the dough over the butter so it’s completely encased, like an envelope. Pinch the edges to seal.

3. **Roll and fold**: Roll the dough out into a long rectangle (about 20 x 10 inches or 50 x 25 cm). Then, fold it into thirds (like a letter). This is your first "turn." Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 30 minutes to an hour.
   
4. **Repeat the folding**: After chilling, roll out the dough again into a rectangle, and fold it into thirds once more. Repeat this process (rolling and folding) two more times, for a total of **four turns**. Each time you roll and fold, make sure to refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes to keep the butter from melting.

#### **Step 4: Shape the Croissants**
1. **Roll the dough**: After the final fold and chilling, roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick.
   
2. **Cut the dough**: Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the dough into long triangles (about 4-5 inches wide at the base and 8 inches long). You should get about 12-14 triangles, depending on the size.
   
3. **Shape the croissants**: Starting from the wide base, roll each triangle up tightly toward the tip, making sure to curve the ends slightly to form a crescent shape.

#### **Step 5: Proof and Bake**
1. **Proof the croissants**: Place the shaped croissants on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Leave some space between each one to allow for expansion. Cover loosely with a clean towel and let them rise at room temperature for about 1-2 hours, or until they have puffed up and look slightly airy.

2. **Preheat the oven**: While the croissants are proofing, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Make sure the oven is fully preheated before baking.

3. **Egg wash**: Beat an egg and brush it gently over the croissants for a golden, shiny finish.

4. **Bake**: Bake the croissants for 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and fully puffed up. Keep an eye on them toward the end to avoid over-baking.

5. **Cool**: Let the croissants cool slightly on a wire rack before serving.

### Tips for Success:
- **Cold ingredients are key**: The butter should remain cold throughout the process to create the flaky layers.
- **Resting times are crucial**: Don’t skip the chilling times between turns. This keeps the butter firm and the dough workable.
- **Don’t rush**: Croissant-making is all about patience. The longer you spend on the lamination and resting steps, the better your croissants will be.
